This repository contains three machine learning projects from bharat intern focused on different aspects of predictive modeling and each project is implemented using linear regression

TASK : 1

House Price Prediction :

"Machine Learning model to predict house price using linear regression only Jupyter notebook code.."

TASK : 2

Wine Quality Prediction :

"Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine using linear regression only Jupyter notebook code."

In this project i also used flask to deploy our Machine Learning model in a simple html web site.

TASK : 3

Iris Flowers Classification :

"Predict the different species of flowers on the length of there petals and sepals only Jupyter notebook code."
